## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

### Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have an idea about new feature you can open a issue.
Before doing that please go through README and existing issues(both open and closed) and check if that question already exist to avoid duplication.
Once the issue is created we will discuss it there and decide the next actions.

If that would be something you think you can fix, please suggest your solution and we can coordinated accordingly.
When making changes on code please go through all code for understanding whole picture in order to make change affect everything it should but no more, and to do it in the correct way.

After that Tests should up updated if change affects them, or new Tests could be created.
Lastly README should be updated if additional explanations are required regarding the change.

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. 
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)). Please follow coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading the code and you'll get the hang of it. It is optimized for readability:

  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
